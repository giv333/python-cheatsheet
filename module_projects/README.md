This repository contains clean and structured beginner projects demonstrating Python modules and object-oriented programming. It is split into two real-world use cases:

##  Grocery List (Module Practice)
- Modular code using simple functions
- Add, remove, and view items

### How to Run
```bash
cd module_projects/grocerylist
python main.py
```

## Smart Playlist (Class + Module Practice)
- Uses classes and inheritance (`Song`, `DownloadedSong`)
- Demonstrates OOP and modular design
- Add, remove, view, and clear songs

### How to Run
```bash
cd module_projects/smartplaylist
python main.py
```

## What I Learn
- How to organize Python code using modules
- Basics of object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Realistic beginner projects
- Writing reusable code with importable logic
