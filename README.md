#  Beginner Python Cheatsheet by DeboX

Welcome to my beginner Python cheatsheet! This is a personal project created to practice and showcase the foundational building blocks of Python programming. The code examples inside are clean, beginner-friendly, and reflect my journey from zero to Python pro. ðŸš€

  Dictionary Practice


students = {
    "Jude": 85,
    "Sarah": 80,
    "Mariam": 90,
    "Mike": 75
}

students.pop("Mariam")
students["John"] = 99

print(students)




 Class Practice: Laptop Showcase

class Laptop:
    def __init__(self, brand, RAM, price):
        self.brand = brand
        self.RAM = RAM
        self.price = price

    def introduce(self):
        print(f"Brand: {self.brand}, RAM: {self.RAM}, Price: {self.price}")

describe1 = Laptop("Dell", "16GB", 50000)
describe2 = Laptop("HP", "8GB", 40000)

describe1.introduce()
describe2.introduce()



   List Practice: To-Do App

tasks = ["Study Python", "Do laundry", "Buy food", "Call friend"]

tasks.remove("Do laundry")
tasks.append("Appointment")
tasks.append("Meeting")
tasks.append("Learning")
tasks.append("Gym")

print(f"My to-do stuffs for today is {tasks}")
