# 🐍 Python Cheatsheet Projects

This is a structured and beginner-friendly collection of Python projects I built to practice real-world coding skills.  
Each folder represents a specific area of Python I'm mastering — from core logic and functions to randomness, modules, and packages.

I'm using this repo to learn by doing, track my progress, and build a clean portfolio as I grow from beginner to professional.

## 📁 Project Structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [`core_snippets/`](./core_snippets/) | Practice files with basic Python logic (dicts, lists, classes) |
| [`module_projects/`](./module_projects/) | Beginner hands-on projects using Python functions and modules |
| [`package_projects/`](./package_projects/) | Structured Python projects using packages and `__init__.py` |
| [`random_projects/`](./random_projects/) | Fun tools and simulations built using the `random` module |
| [`file_directory_projects/`](./file_directory_projects/) | Projects that explore file handling and directory navigation |
---

## 🔹 core_snippets/

> Small examples to understand Python syntax and logic.

- [`practice_cheatsheet.md`](./core_snippets/practice_cheatsheet.md):  
  Learn and practice using:
  - Dictionaries
  - Lists and task management
  - Custom classes and methods

---

## 🔹 module_projects/

> Real-life mini-apps built using Python modules.

- [`grocerylist/`](./module_projects/grocerylist/):  
  Add, remove, and view grocery items with simple functions.

- [`smartplaylist/`](./module_projects/smartplaylist/):  
  Build a smart playlist using classes, inheritance, and method overrides.

---

## 🔹 package_projects/

> Structured like real Python packages with importable modules.

- [`LibrarySystem/`](./package_projects/LibrarySystem/):  
  Simulates a library with `Book` and `BorrowedBook` classes.  
  Helps practice:
  - Python package layout
  - Class import across folders
  - Modular file structure

---

## 🔹 random_projects/

> Projects using randomness for games, generators, and simulations.

| Project | Feature | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| [`password_generator`](./random_projects/password_generator/) | `random.choice()` | Generate secure passwords |
| [`dice_duel_game`](./random_projects/dice_duel_game/) | `random.randint()` | Simulate a two-player dice game |
| [`weather_simulator`](./random_projects/weather_simulator/) | `random.uniform()` | Generate temperature ranges |
| [`lucky_draw`](./random_projects/lucky_draw/) | `random.sample()` | Pick winners from a list |
| [`flashcard_shuffler`](./random_projects/flashcard_shuffler/) | `random.shuffle()` | Shuffle flashcards for study sessions |


## 🔹 file_directory_projects/

> Mini projects to practice working with files and folders in Python.

| Project | Feature | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| [`note_saver`](./file_directory_projects/note_saver/) | `open()` in append mode | Save user notes to a `.txt` file |
| [`file_scanner`](./file_directory_projects/file_scanner/) | `pathlib.Path().rglob()` | Recursively scan a folder for `.py` files |


Each project includes:
- Beginner-friendly Python code
- A clear README explanation
- Example output file

## 💡 Why I Built This

- 🧠 To deeply understand Python by writing hands-on examples  
- 📦 To organize everything I learn into clean, modular projects  
- 🗂️ To simulate how real developers structure their code  
- 🚀 To track my learning progress and document my growth on GitHub
